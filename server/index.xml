      <description>Outstanding career success can often seem out of reach. We know that to succeed, we need both ability and opportunity. But when it comes to advancing past a certain point, access to the right opportunity can become the most limiting factor. To better understand how to optimize for opportunity, I studied the career paths of 11 people who were at least engineering directors or principal engineers. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I found.</description>

      <description>Zuck (IG Post, FB Post) and some news outlets (ex1, ex2, ex3, ex4) highlighted some of the work our team did in video compute efficiency.
We reduced the cost to produce our basic video encodings by 94%. As a byproduct we were able to use that compute to improve advanced encoding watchtime coverage by 33%. These advanced encodings improve the user experience through higher visual quality and less stalls. If this sounds interesting to you, I wrote an engineering blog post with all the engineering details here</description>

      <description>Had a lot of fun partnering with the ads org on optimizing the performance of video ads, which had been neglected for some time. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reading about how we reduced memory errors 98% and drove a 3.9% increase in watch time, check out the blog post here.</description>

      <title>Why Write</title>

      <description>I’ve been thinking about writing for a while but have had difficulty seeing the benefit. Usually when people talk about writing, the benefits I often hear are (1) to connect with others and (2) to build a following. Both of these points may have value but the payoff is uncertain and not completely in my control. To warrant writing, I needed to find other benefits which were in my control and likely to happen.</description>
